      Born and raised on Vancouver Island, I enjoy spending time outdoors. I
      love camping, traveling, playing board games, and spending time with
      family and friends. I recently learned to play the Irish concertina, and
      am very much enjoying the sense of accomplishment in learning a new
      instrument.
